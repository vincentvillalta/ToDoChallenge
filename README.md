# ToDoChallenge


# Requirements:
Design a simple “To Do” application for iOS/iPhone
The application will allow you to add a new ToDo item and also allow you to delete a ToDo item (bonus for adding Master – Detail screens)
You have complete flexibility to design the layout the way you want.  We want to see your design approach.
We want to see both approaches for transitioning through the pages.  We want to see transitions via the storyboards and then also see transitions using code.
Proper navigation is expected
Bonus points for using SQLite as your data storage for your persistent storage
 
The goal of the project is to give you as much flexibility as possible to see your approach and to see your design skills.

# Additional:
Used Rx observers to prevent usage of NSNotifications nor delegates
Use SQLite as persistance database
Basic UI
Navigation using segues on storyboard and programatically
Split view implementation
